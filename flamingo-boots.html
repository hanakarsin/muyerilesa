A huge amount of top pro Smash Bros. players were linked to sexual assault and pedophilia charges and a sizable amount of popular Twitch personalities were also embroiled in scandals of their own that ultimately resulted in cancellations and bans from their respective platforms. Now, <a href=#>Flamingo</a> has found himself at the center of some drama too.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The drama with Flamingo began when people unearthed unsavory jokes from his past.</h2><p>Like most people who've had their online histories excavated by members of the online community, Flamingo, real name Albert Spencer Aretz, reportedly made some "controversial" jokes that didn't sit well with a lot of people. The 23-year-old Roblox gamer has 7 million YouTube subscribers and nearly 789,000 Instagram followers to boot.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So is Flamingo "canceled"?</h2><p>The term no personality ever wants to hear is now being floated around in association with Flamingo's name for some of the content he uploaded to his other channel, AlbertStuff. Videos of him saying the n-word and then correcting himself (it needs to be slowed down for you to hear it, which the uploader has done) along with saying "tr---y" in a clip were compiled and uploaded to social media. You can watch it for yourself below.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Flamingo has said the nword and the t slur <a href=#>https://t.co/MfawxiR6bN</a></p>‚Äî CHECK BIO FOR YTüòò (@sofionh) <a href=#>August 17, 2020</a></figure><p>Flamingo posted a text apology that he screenshot and uploaded to several of his social media accounts, apologizing for language and jokes he made in the past. He writes, "there's a lot of insensitive content and jokes I've made in the past that I've completely distanced myself from for years."</p><p>He went on to say he's "completely ashamed of the things [he's] said" and that he "want[s] to continue only making content that is inclusive to everyone."</p><p>You can check out his entire apology that was uploaded to Twitter below. It's already garnered over 4,800 retweets and nearly 42,000 likes.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Please read, I‚Äôm sorry. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YPTj17GXhd</a></p>‚Äî Albert (@AlbertsStuff) <a href=#>August 18, 2020</a></figure><p>Interestingly enough, there were many individuals in the comments section who expressed that Flamingo shouldn't be the subject of "cancellation" and that the jokes in question were made when he was much younger. Others said that the YouTuber has clearly grown since then and he doesn't have a track record of malicious or mean-spirited behavior, either.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I meant that as in you shouldn't apologize for making a fucking joke, no matter how offensive it is, it's still just a fucking joke, he wasnt serious, he was just joking</p>‚Äî Glitchy Boi (@GlitchRager) <a href=#>August 19, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don't understand why people aren't accepting this apology. Yeah, I get that what he said was offensive, but he's changed, he's taken accountability, he's moved on, and he's not playing the victim card. 1/2</p>‚Äî Grutwo (@Grutwo2) <a href=#>August 20, 2020</a></figure><p>There were others who weren't as accepting of his apology however and began pointing to newer "insensitive" jokes that he's made online about the COVID-19 pandemic. While the joke wasn't directly referenced, the person in question said the "joke" was Flamingo reading someone's confusing username and then quipping that trying to understand it gave him COVID.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>But you also joked about covid in one of your vids. I dont remember which one but you said "your name gives me covid" because their name was something like hhghgjfjfjdhdjs.. :/</p>‚Äî ‚ãÑ‚îÅ‚ó§…™…™·¥ã…™…¥…¢_·¥ä·¥Äx…™·¥á ‚ó¢‚îÅ‚ãÑ (@jaxifur) <a href=#>August 20, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Y‚Äôall know he‚Äôs talking about the jokes against Mexicans too right? And I personally forgive him for that, after all I think he‚Äôs taking the right steps to change his ways by deleting albertsstuff, and although that channel will be missed, it‚Äôs a reminiscence</p>‚Äî Elizabeth Rivas (@Elizabe71269057) <a href=#>August 20, 2020</a></figure><p>For the most part, however, many people have told Flamingo that they either never had a problem with his jokes in the first place or that they've forgiven him for the things he's said regardless.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>hey. it's alright just do better!</p>‚Äî The new DQ chicken flamethrower (@DumbassMusic) <a href=#>August 20, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It‚Äôs alright Flamingo, people are just being rude, no need to apologize to these imbeciles. Just know that we all love you as a human being and that will never change :(</p>‚Äî TheFatMarioBros (@TheFatMarioBros) <a href=#>August 20, 2020</a></figure><p>Others went so far as to call the personality's critics "imbeciles," with some Twitter users textually eye-rolling at "cancel culture" by tweeting the #cancelisoverparty hashtag.</p><p>What do you think? Are you a Flamingo stan regardless and think that he's proven to be a good egg? Or is his apology not up to your personal standards?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2Oxqr%2FTq5icrJmbxm%2BvzqZmmqaZoq6tv45rZ2pvX2WFcH2XaG59pGabfKe4wKagp5%2BfYq%2Bwu9Os</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tiktok-fake-window-challenge.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TikTok's Fake Window Challenge Is All About Lighting Tricks">&larr;
