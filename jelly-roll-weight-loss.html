Despite being active since 2003, he rose to prominence with the releases of 2021's "Son of a Sinner" and 2023's "Need a Favor." He received additional praise with the release of his song, "Save Me," in which he wears his vulnerability on his sleeve and reveals his emotional turmoil with his lyrics.</p><p>Jelly Roll has since become a major country music star. He has been nominated for and won several country music awards in 2023. In 2024, he was even nominated for two Grammy Awards.</p><p>He continues to rise in the music industry and has even become a staunch advocate against distributing illegal drugs following his own stint with substance abuse. Among his growing achievements, Jelly Roll has also committed to a new fitness journey after running in a 5k race. Here's what we know so far.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jelly Roll is committed to weight loss after competing in a 5k race.</h2><p>In early May 2024, Jelly Roll competed in a 5k run. The event, titled "2 Bears 5K," was announced by 2 Bears, 1 Cave podcast hosts and comedians <a href=#>Tom Segura</a> and <a href=#>Bert Kreischer</a> and presented by Netflix is a Joke Fest.</p><p>Jelly Roll spoke about his journey during an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with Entertainment Tonight, in which he divulged how hard he had worked to be able to participate in the event.</p><p>"I couldn't walk a mile when I started trying to do this back in January," he told the outlet. "So the fact that we got 3-point-whatever it was, got it down, I felt really, really good about it."</p><p>He was incredibly proud of himself after completing the run, and it just goes to show how much his hard work and training has paid off leading up to the 5k.</p><p>According to Jelly Roll, he had lost somewhere between 50â€“70 pounds in preparing for the race, which is quite an impressive feat. What's more, he has even inspired others after participating in the run.</p><p>"I think the coolest thing is how many people stopped to tell us that they were motivated by us, other big guys," he told Entertainment Tonight.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>His participation in the 5k came after the country singer stepped away from social media for an extended period. In an episode of her Dumb Blonde podcast, Jelly Roll's <a href=#>wife</a> Bunnie XO revealed that her husband had been bullied extensively for his weight on all of his social media challenges, prompting his break from his platforms.</p><p>At the time, she stressed, "Don't bully people because you never know where they are mentally."</p><p>Jelly Roll has returned to social media following his weight loss and is already super excited to keep running, declaring, "Next year, a half marathon! We're saying it now, absolutely!"</p><p>We wish Jelly Roll all the best as he works towards his fitness goals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KtuNhmqaiknGLEprXGoatmpJ%2BowA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./biafra-ohanaeze-blasts-umahi-for-claiming-to-have-initiated-nnamdi-kanus-release-with-buhari.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ohanaeze Blasts Umahi For Claiming To Have Initiated Nnamdi Kanu's Release With Buhari">&larr;
