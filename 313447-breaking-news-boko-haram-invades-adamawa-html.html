As I am taking to you now, I am in Kala and I saw the soldiers in convoys of cars leaving the town. It is just a pity that we are not telling ourselves the truth, because there is nothing like ceasefire with Boko Haram. People are just suffering and somebody is out there playing politics with their lives. It was just a pity that I was driving and could not take the picture of those fleeing soldiers. This country is in serious trouble,”</i> the source said.</p><p>But another military source has revealed that soldiers are currently conducting aerial raids to rid the area of insurgents.</p><p>Daily Trust also reports that some residents said they heard artillery gun fires.</p><p>Another resident in Uba town of the state, who did not want his name published, said people were panicking following speculations of an impending attack by Boko Haram insurgents in the town. It was gathered that many of the residents fled to safety but it was later learned that no such attack was in the offing as the suspected insurgents passed by Uba, while on their way to Mubi. A resident of Mubi who gave his name as Habeeb confirmed that fighter jets were hovering around the town since 9 am, but could not ascertain if it belongs to the Nigeria military. Habeeb further hinted that people tried to run away from the city centre onto the hills but even the hills were not safe.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Boko Haram: 30 Policemen Still Missing - IGP Says</a></p><p><i>The blast is too much, everybody is running helter-skelter. Even the mountain that we climbed to run away from the gun fire was bombed by aircraft. I don’t know who owns the aircraft whether it is Nigerian Army or Boko Haram,”</i> Habeeb said.<i>“Thirty minutes after the aerial bombing, we climbed up again but the planes returned and bombed it again. We have descended from the mountains affected which are Gaya and Munda. We are looking for exit because the Yola road is blocked and the gunshots and bomb blasts are happening on the Uba road axis. We may go to Maiha through the mountains or we will enter Cameroun if Maiha is impossible.”</i></p><p>However, the military spokesperson could not be reached for comments by the time of filing this story.</p><p class=h2>Also, some eyewitnesses took to Twitter to describe what was going on around them:</p><p>This attack is coming less than less 48 hours after <a href=#>Boko Haram suspects reportedly stormed Kukawa town, </a>Borno State, on October 27, killing several people and destroying property.</p><p>The sect members have continued to wreak havoc after they have allegedly entered a ceasefire agreement with the Federal Government, leaving many Nigerians with elated expectation of releasing the abducted Chibok girls on<a href=#> October 27, 2014</a>, but only to hear of more deadly attacks.</p><p>It would be recalled that President Goodluck Jonathan recently <a href=#>increased the number of security personnel fighting the insurgents in the North Eastern part </a>of the country in a bid to put an end to their activities.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHJ%2Fk21uZpqimq6stc2gZKedp6h6o7vKqGShmaKWum61za%2BYnZ2jYq6lrcyarppmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-ashton-below-deck.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened to Ashton on 'Below Deck'?
