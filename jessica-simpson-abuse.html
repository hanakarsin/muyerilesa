It would start with tickling my back and then go into things that were extremely uncomfortable,” she writes. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>She continues: “I wanted to tell my parents. I was the victim, but somehow I felt in the wrong.”&nbsp;</p><p>Reflecting on her painful past, Jessica explains that part of her healing process was needing to "confront [her] abuser." She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> in an interview, "It was extremely painful and still is. It’s still shocking. That little girl in me wanting to do the right thing, not knowing how to stand up for herself and not knowing how to stop it.”</p><p>The singer explained to the outlet that she was shaped by her difficult past, and that she was "very shameful" during the six years of keeping the troubling abuse a secret. "I allowed it to happen, so I felt that I was as much of the abuser as the abused," she added.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the blonde beauty eventually confided in her parents, Tina and Joe Simpson, at the age of 12 about what she had experienced. "I told you something was happening," Jessica's mom said while simultaneously slapping her father's arm during a car trip.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Thank you @people for helping me share my story.

She reveals to fans that she hit rock bottom after attending a Halloween party, telling her close pals, "I need to stop. Something’s got to stop. And if it’s the alcohol that’s doing this, and making things worse, then I quit.”&nbsp;</p><p>She adds: “When I finally said I needed help, it was like I was that little girl that found her calling again in life. I found direction and that was to walk straight ahead with no fear.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Jessica decided to seek professional help and started attending weekly therapy sessions to help her cope with her past.&nbsp;“With work, I allowed myself to feel the traumas I’d been through,” she says.&nbsp;And, the pop star explains that giving up drinking was not difficult for her to do, saying, “I was mad at that bottle. At how it allowed me to stay complacent and numb.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As she continues to live a sober lifestyle with her husband Eric Johnson and their three kids &nbsp;— Maxwell, 7, Ace, 6, Birdie, 10 months — Jessica's new memoir gives a glimpse into her personal struggles. “It’s been a long hard deep emotional journey."&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, the clothing designer writes that she's "come through the other side" and by sharing her story, she can turn her pain into "something that can be beautiful and hopefully inspiring to people.”</p><p>Open Book will be available on Feb. 4.</p><p><strong>If you need support, The National Sexual Assault Hotline is available 24/7 at&nbsp;1-800-656-4673.
