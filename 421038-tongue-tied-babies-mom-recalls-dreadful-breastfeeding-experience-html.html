I told my ob-gyn that something was not right. She told me to consult a lactation consultant to check on us. I went to two visits with the lactation consultant and explained to them how painful breastfeeding was and my nipples were cut and bleeding," Wanjau told <strong>TUKO.co.ke.</strong><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/04d2333d1742075b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Mom Says Infection on Cracked Breast Made Her Stop Breastfeeding 3-Months-Old Baby</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The lactation consultant then suggested that Wanjau uses a nipple shield and try changing the positioning of the baby when feeding him.

Follow TUKO.co.ke on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter!</a></strong></p>"I dreaded each breastfeeding session. I noted even the pumping was making the situation worse so I returned the breast pump they gave me. I decided to get a second opinion from a government agency that helps mothers and children here in the USA. When the lactation consultant there checked on my son she noted he had a tongue tie," Wanjau told <strong>TUKO.co.ke.</strong><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/04d2333d1742075b.jpeg><p class=align-left>Wanjau had no idea what that was. It was then that the doctor told her that this should have been checked the minute she started complaining of pain when breastfeeding.</p>"I was told to contact my son's paediatrician and he was scheduled for outpatient surgery to correct the tongue-tie. I was referred back to the hospital lactation consultants and when they saw the damage on my nipples they advised me to stop breastfeeding. That was the end of our breastfeeding journey. My son was four months," Wanjau narrated.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7775962729401e82.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>33-Year-Old Mother Who Went to University after Marriage Failed Finally Bags Degree</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Install our latest app for Android, read the best news on Kenya’s #1 news app</a></strong></p><p class=align-left>For her second child, Wanjau was now prepared and armed with information.</p>"As soon as she was delivered I asked the doctors to check if she had a tongue tie. Unfortunately, 6 hours after birth they had to rush her to the Nicu. She was on machines for 2 weeks and I was not allowed to breastfeed her. The nurses encouraged me to continue pumping so that my breast milk would not disappear," she recalled.<p class=align-left>When she was finally discharged, Wanjau tried breastfeeding and her daughter was not a fan.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: <a href=#>Click 'See First' under 'Follow' Tab to see Tuko.co.ke news on your FB Feed</a></strong></p>"She would get very frustrated and cry because of not having the instant milk she was used to from a bottle. Contacted lactation consultants and they advised as long as she was feeding from the bottle, all that mattered was to pump and feed her instead. That is what I resulted to do until she was eight months," Wanjau explained. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6f5b5df39d2cea3f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Mom Says Her Body Refused to Produce Milk after Giving Birth at 35 Weeks</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Wanjau has now learnt from experience that breastfeeding is never a defined route.</p><p class=align-left>She swore never to judge any parent that does not breastfeed a child because it is not a natural process for all.</p><p class=align-left><strong>TUKO.co.ke</strong> recently published a story of how a mom got an infection on a c<a href=#>racked breast that made her stop breastfeeding a three-month-old baby.</a></p><p class=align-left>Catherine Akinyi said according to her doctor, the infection was caused by the use of breast pads and not changing them frequently.</p><p class=align-left>The situation got so bad that the doctor asked her to stop breastfeeding her child when he was only three months, to first focus on her recovery.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
