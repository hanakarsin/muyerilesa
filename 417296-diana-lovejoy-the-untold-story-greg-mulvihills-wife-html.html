The duo lived together as husband and wife for seven years.</p><p class=align-left>However, their marriage was not a bed of roses as she suffered eight miscarriages before she finally gave birth to their son. Diana Lovejoy and Greg Mulvihill's relationship did not have a happily ever after ending as she filed for divorce in 2014.</p><p class=align-left>Diana Lovejoy's case took two years. At first, the court granted her full custody of their son, and Greg was only allowed to visit him for a few hours under supervision. She cited sexual abuse as the reason for the divorce, but the investigations disapproved the claims.</p><p class=align-left>Greg was required to pay $100 per month as child support. In summer 2016, the court ruled that Greg and his wife should share custody of their son and the monthly payments for child support. At that time, she was earning $10,000 per month.
