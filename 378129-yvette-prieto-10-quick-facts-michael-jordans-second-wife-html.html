However, many people are not familiar with his personal life, especially regarding his current wife. So, who is Michael Jordan's second wife, Yvette Prieto?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/6cc90f3db7d6fcd7.jpeg><p class=align-left>To many people, Yvette is simply Michael Jordan’s second wife. There is much more to her than that. The beauty is not only a former model, but she is also well educated and boasts of significant net worth.</p><h2>10 facts about Yvette Prietto, Michael Jordan’s second wife</h2><p class=align-left>From modelling for designer Alexander Wang to appearing in a documentary, Mrs Prieto wasn’t new to the celebrity status before she met Michael Jordan. But since her marriage, the former model has taken a back seat and rarely appears in public. Here are some interesting things to know about her career and personal life.</p><h3>1. She is Cuban-American</h3><p class=align-left>Where is Yvette Prieto from? Most people might be mistaken for thinking she is from America. However, this is not the case.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4e7f08681081d668.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kate Norley: 10 quick facts to know about John Oliver's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Prieto was born in Cuba to Parents Carlos and Maria Prieto. Her parents moved to America while Yvette was still a child. She grew up in Miami and used to live in the South Beach area, making her a native of the region. Later on, Yvette gained American citizenship. Therefore, she is a Cuban-American national.</p><h3>2. She studied business management</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4e7f08681081d668.jpeg><p class=align-left>Yvette is not just a pretty face; she is a smart individual too. She went to college, where she studied and graduated with a degree in business management.</p><p class=align-left>After graduating, she put her education to use by working several jobs in Miami. These include working in a hospital and a real estate management company.</p><p class=align-left>Later, she went to work for her father in their family company. However, she was disillusioned, which saw her leave the company for other pursuits.</p><h3>3. She is a model</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f83369014ae6b17b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Luke Combs' wife? The untold story of Nicole Hocking</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What does Yvette Prieto do for a living today? Aside from her relationship with Michael Jordan, she is known for being a model.</p><p class=align-left>While working for her father, Prieto disagreed with the way things were being run. This led her to quit the business world altogether. Her next career choice was modelling, and she started by doing commercial ads and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">bikini photoshoots</a>.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Get to know more about Ellen DeGeneres' wife</p><p class=align-left>Yvette was quite successful in the modelling world, as she would later start working with some top designers and brands. Her most noticeable achievement as a model was working for fashion designer Alexander Wang. Aside from modelling, she also appeared in a documentary, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cuba: An Island Apart</a></i> (as herself.)</p><p class=align-left>So, what does Yvette do for a living today? Ever since she started her relationship with Michael Jordan, she has kept a low profile. However, from time to time, she will be spotted at public events, such as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">fashion shows</a>. She also makes frequent public appearances <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">with her husband</a> at both social and official events.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d6d73f021751e885.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Vanessa Arevalo: Quick facts about Cameron Mathison's wife</span></p></a><h3>4. She once declared bankruptcy</h3><p class=align-left>Despite having had a successful modelling career, Prieto ran into financial troubles early on in her life. In 2002 – at 23 – she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filed for chapter 7</a> to protect herself from her debt obligations.</p><p class=align-left>Luckily, declaring bankruptcy did not affect her life for too long. After two years, Yvette managed to fix her financial situation. And being married to one of the wealthiest men, it is doubtful she will be running into financial troubles soon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/14ea39fb8f6ba12e.jpeg><p class=align-left>So, what is her financial status today? Currently, Yvette Prieto's net worth is estimated to be around <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$5 million</a>. And as long as she is married to Michael Jordan, she is part of his massive net worth that is estimated to be about <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$2.2 billion</a>.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Phil Daniels biography, wife, net worth, movies and tv shows</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9f4410d7ebb96694.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Vanessa Kingori: The story of Kenyan-born British Vogue Publishing Director</span></p></a><h3>5. Her family got into trouble with the law</h3><p class=align-left>Prieto has been one of those celebrities who are nearly squeaky clean, with no skeletons in the closet. However, during her early years, she was at the centre of a crime involving her family. In 2001, her parents and other people working in their family company were accused of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">insurance fraud</a>.</p><p class=align-left>According to investigators, the family billed insurance companies for services they did not provide. As a result, they ended up collecting over $400,000 illegally. Yvette's parents were convicted of fraud charges, later on, served 18 months in prison.</p><p class=align-left>Prieto was not incriminated in the insurance fraud. At the time, she had already left the company. And considering that she declared bankruptcy a while later, it is safe to assume that she did not benefit from it in any way.</p><h3>6. She is Michael Jordan’s second wife</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/206a76df1ee6fd43.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Marie Pierre Bouchard: quick facts about the Just For Laughs star</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Despite already being in the limelight as a model, Prieto shot to fame when she started dating the basketball star. So, how did Michael Jordan Meet Yvette Prieto? The couple first met at a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Miami night club</a> in 2008. Michael managed to catch Prieto's eye because she was "freak dancing".</p><p class=align-left>Soon after meeting, they started a friendship that blossomed into a relationship. In 2009, the couple started living together after dating for some time. Their first home was a 3<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">-bedroom suburban home</a> in Kendal, Florida. It was relatively modest, and they only paid $300,000 for it.</p><p class=align-left>After dating for two years, Michael Jordan popped the question, and Prieto agreed to marry him. However, before they walked down the aisle, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">signed a prenup agreement</a>.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> NBA star Stephen Jackson biography: Wife, kids, family, controversies</p><p class=align-left>According to the contract, in the event of a divorce, she would receive $1 million for every year of marriage. After ten years, the payment would go up to $5 million every year. Given the expensive divorce from his first wife Juanita Vanoy, which cost him $168 million, the prenup was understandable. However, the couple finally tied the knot in April 2013.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/895e8e723d0dc297.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Gael Anderson: 5 things to know about Andrew Lincoln's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>So, is Michael Jordan still married to Yvette Prieto? Yes, and happily. Despite the concerns some people seemed to have, their marriage is still going strong seven years later. They have both <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">been spotted</a> at various events over the years, each sporting a huge smile.</p><h3>7. Her wedding was an A-list event</h3><p class=align-left>While their first home together was modest, the Yvette Prieto wedding was one to remember. It was the event of the century that attracted <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">over 300 guests</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The wedding was held at Episcopal Church Bethesda-by-the-Sea. It attracted huge names, starting with NBA stars such as Scottie Pippen and Patrick Ewing. Other notable names in attendance included Ahmad Rashad, Tiger Woods, and Spike Lee.</p><p class=align-left>After tying the knot, the couple hosted a larger gathering of guests at Bear’s Club for a reception. Just like with the wedding, the affair was very lavish. Singers Usher and Robin Thicke performed at the event, and guests were treated to a 7-layer cake. In total, the wedding is estimated to have cost <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$10 million</a>, making it one of the most expensive.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/091bb0c2889257a9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Galina Becker: 10 seriously interesting facts about Roman Reign's wife</span></p></a><h3>8. She is a private person with little social media activity</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f83369014ae6b17b.jpeg><p class=align-left>Immediately after she started dating Michael Jordan, Yvette attracted a lot of attention from the media. The situation became worse when they announced their engagement. With very little information about the model, paparazzi and journalists tried to uncover as much information about her as possible.</p><p class=align-left>However, the couple persevered and has mostly kept a low profile since then. Unlike many famous people, there is rarely any activity about their personal life on social media. The only time they are in the limelight is during social and business events.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> A look into Lorie Campbell and Paul Campbell relationship</p><h3>9. She is a proud mother of twins and a stepmother to three</h3><p class=align-left>A few months after their wedding, Yvette and Jordan announced they were expecting. The couple welcomed their twin daughters Ysabel and Victoria Jordan in 2014.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/197192e1cfafb668.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mary Marquardt: Interesting details about Harrison Ford's first wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Aside from the twins, Yvette is a stepmom to three of Michael Jordan's other kids from his first marriage. They are Jasmine, Marcus, and Jeffery Jordan.</p><p class=align-left>So, how old are Michael Jordan's twins? The girls were born on February 9, 2014. That makes them six years old today. Due to their parents’ private nature, there are rarely any pictures of them online, and they are seldom exposed to the public.</p><h3>10. She has a considerable age gap with her husband</h3><p class=align-left>Prieto and Jordan have some noticeable differences, one of them being their age gap. Michael Jordan, born February 17, 1963, is currently 57 years. So, when was Yvette Prieto born? She was born around March 1979, making her about 41 years old.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, there is a 16-year age gap between the two. This has earned them a spot in the list of celebrity couples with the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">largest age gaps</a>. However, it seems that age is just a number, as they have experienced a happy marriage since tying the knot.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ded2b22f17a533fd.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kate Silverton: 10 interesting facts about the BBC journalist</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello love story and relationship</p><p class=align-left>Aside from their age gap, Yvette and Michael Jordan also have other noticeable differences. To start with, Yvette is Hispanic, while MJ is African American. This makes them one of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hottest interracial celeb couples</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Another difference between the two is their height. Michael Jordan is a whopping 6 feet 6 inches, while his wife comes in at 5’6. This makes a significant difference of 12 inches.</p><p class=align-left>While there is a lot of information about Yvette Prieto out there, she is a private person. In fact, before becoming Michael Jordan's second wife, not much is known about her previous life. She doesn't give interviews and doesn't post about her personal life on social media.</p><p class=align-left>That being said, Yvette Prieto is an impressive personality who moved to a new country at a young age. She also went through several challenges and overcame them. Today, she is Michael Jordan's second wife and a mother. She enjoys a happy life with her family.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7f52171bba9d1022.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Eiza González: 10 fast facts you should know about Timothée Chalamet girlfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke created a biography of Sunshine Kiki Brown, Clayne Crawford’s wife of over 16 years.
