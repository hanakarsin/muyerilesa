The support he expected from the people is not coming. He has realised that he needs the governors to win this election.</p><p>“He had the chance and missed the opportunity. Now, the five aggrieved governors are recruiting more people to join them. If Atiku doesn’t move fast, Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State will join the G-5 governors.</p><p>“As I speak, there is no prominent PDP leader from the South who is with Atiku. Those people parading themselves as Southern PDP leaders can’t win elections in their villages.</p><p>“The problem now is that the people who can prevail on Wike and other governors are those Atiku offended in the past. He has offended Jonathan and even worked against him in 2015.</p><p>“He undermined Obasanjo in 2003. He worked against Odili in 2007. Edwin Clark doesn’t want to even see Atiku for working against Jonathan in 2015. Same thing with Bode George.</p><p>“Leaders of Ohanaeze Ndigbo who worked for him in 2019, can’t openly support him. These people I’ve mentioned are those who can prevail on these aggrieved governors to work with Atiku.”</p><p>The source added that Atiku may have the support of the North, but won’t get a landslide victory because the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Rabiu Kwakwanso will drag the votes with him in the north.</p><p>He noted that Atiku’s vote will be affected in the North East because of the presence of the vice presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Kashim Shettima.</p><p>The source who claimed that the presidential candidate of APC, Bola Tinubu can boast of 80 per cent of votes from the South West, said Atiku can’t do the same in the North.</p><p>He said with Obi in the race, Atiku has lost South East, and can not boast of 30 per cent in the South-South over issues with Wike.</p><p>The source said Atiku is careful of upsetting his Northern Muslim support base, which does not want him to associate with Wike.</p><p>The PDP member said if Atiku concedes some grounds and positions to the G-5 governors, he will gain their support.</p><p>The source said while Tinubu is willing to concede some cabinet positions to the G-5 governors, Atiku on the other hand is unwilling to commit himself.</p><p>The source warned, “If Atiku’s kitchen cabinet members mean well for him, they need to tell him the truth now. The G-5 governors must be brought on board before the end of November or PDP can just bid Aso Rock goodbye.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BrZpqsmaDCbrnOr5ysZaSkerOxwqilnKGcmnq4tdOhZKBlZWK0sMLSZqabmaOWu6u7jJqemqGeqMFuvNGeqqKclaPBqq3LZpimmpmptrC6jKymrqqTmnw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./henry-cavill-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Henry Cavill - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;
