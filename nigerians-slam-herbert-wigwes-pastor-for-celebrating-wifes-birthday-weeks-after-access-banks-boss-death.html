Later now una go say Daddy Freeze dey craze. If it was her Son that died will Dr Mrs Siju Iluyomade celebrate that birthday? If it was his Child that died will Pastor Idowu Iluyomade celebrate his wife‚Äôs birthday? Herbert was not just an ordinary member of City of David. HE IS ONE OF THE REASONS CITY OF DAVID EXISTS! Just 2 weeks before his death, Herbert gave this church a 1 billion Naira interest free Loan!</p><p>‚ÄúWhen the church was looking for N600 million to build that Church who was one of the superheroes who pulled in his contacts for a fund raising banquet at Eko atlantic to donate? Who paid the rent of City of David for the first 5 years? Herbert! When contractors left the site during construction of City of David, who stepped in and looked for money on the church‚Äôs behalf? Herbert and Aunty Chizoba!!!</p><p>‚ÄúThe church did the Great Talent project, he gave N300 million. The church wanted to build The Hope Center School in Makoko, Herbert built the classrooms. The Church ran out of money to pay teachers and feed those children daily, Herbert to the rescue. Monthly Salary & stipends for City of David Choir nko? It was still this same Herbert.</p><p>‚ÄúGod is all knowing, God sees all‚Ä¶ In honour of such an important person & dear friend, that lavish birthday party should have been at least POSTPONED‚Ä¶ And held at a much later date. As expected, The Wigwe family is rumoured to have said they dont want Pastor ID and Siju anywhere near Herbert, Aunty Chizoba & Chizi Burial.‚Äù</p><p>@DonaldAyibiowu wrote, ‚ÄúPastor Siju Iluyomade Should Have Just Cancelled The Event She was judged from a point of expectation. Nigerians need to reevaluate their relationship with the church.‚Äù</p><p>On his part, @jondreytips wrote, ‚ÄúI was in a similar situation 2015, birthday planed n sorted, suddenly a 14-year-old girl died in our then compound ü•≤ a girl that was close loved by all oo ‚Ä¶ Birthday was automatically cancelled, holding that Birthday is a lot more insensitive. Churches need to be an example.‚Äù</p><p>Reacting to the development, @sir_enike argued that the most selfish and self-centred people in society were some so-called pastors.</p><p>He wrote: ‚ÄúSadly but a reality, Churches in Nigeria these days only values you for what they benefit from you, as much as you can give to them that‚Äôs all that matters. The most selfish self-centered and highly inconsiderate people in our society today are some so-called pastors or church operators. They are users and have no love of God in them. Many are wicked greedy arrogant and only money-conscious. They have no regard or value for anybody‚Äôs life or impact, all that matters is the money that‚Äôs all.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FuZqehl5q%2Fqq3NrGSspJGieqmx0Zucq6xdrLaow8SsZKmZo6m8s3nFqKlmm5WhsqO%2BwK2gp59drLansdJmmaKqpJ2xosWMsJyeo6NirqfAxKtkmpuTmsC0ecGapaSrXZe8tL%2BMnZyarJhk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./psg-give-al-hilal-access-to-negotiate-with-kylian-mbappe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="PSG Give Al-Hilal Access To Negotiate With Kylian Mbappe">&larr;
