While the two may have played lovebirds on screen, they've been engaging in a friendly back-and-forth over their respective hockey teams for years. Pam reps the St. Louis Blues, while Jim is a Bruins kinda guy.</p><p>The series itself has been a rollercoaster ride for fans of both teams, but especially the Blues. The team was at one point, placed dead last in the NHL's rankings. Many didn't even think the Blues would make the playoffs, let alone the Stanley Cup finals, but here they are and Pam was sure to let Jim know that she was gunning for her St. Louis boys to bring home that glorious trophy.&nbsp;</p><p>The series made it all the way to a game 7, with Jim joking that he was going to take "someone else" to the final game of the series after the actress appeared on TV to spill the beans about their long-time Boston St. Louis rivalry. Yes, this is a grudge that runs back as deep as their days of shooting The Office, where Jim was able to gloat to Pam after the Red Sox swept the Cardinals in the World Series.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Soooooo... I should invite someone else to game 7? <a href=#>https://t.co/3vMH7qSB3w</a></p>— John Krasinski (@johnkrasinski) <a href=#>June 10, 2019</a></figure><p>After seeing Pam's video, Jim promised that he was going to bring someone else to the game in her place, and he dug into The Office's cast to get some help. And who he got sure was a doozy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>He starts the video by being all upbeat and positive about the final game of the anxiety-inducing series, saying stuff like he hopes the best team wins. "Jenna Fischer, I know we’ve been having our ups and downs lately, but I just wanted to say I’m really sorry that you’re not here," John said in the clip he posted at Game 7.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Game 7! Let’s do this!!! <a href=#>#NHL</a> <a href=#>#StanleyCup</a> <a href=#>@jennafischer</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BxMokfdLLr</a></p>— John Krasinski (@johnkrasinski) <a href=#>June 13, 2019</a></figure><p>Then, right in the middle of his speech, he allows someone holding a cup of beer to walk past him, who turns out to be actor David Denman. You might recall he played Roy, Pam's ex-fiancé in The Office. After Roy takes a seat, Jim continues, "This is your seat right here and I’m really bummed that you couldn’t make it." Then he smiles smugly at the camera.</p><p>Jenna had to give it up to John &nbsp;and responded with a gibe of her own. Although this one was more geared towards Roy's character, it was still a wonderful ode to the show that fans are still streaming like crazy to this day.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>As it turns out, Jim wasn't the only Bruins fan at Dunder Mifflin who was rooting for the Stanley Cup to come to Boston. Steve Carrell, who played the lovable dimwit of a boss Michael Scott, posted his own selfie to help root the Bruins to victory. Pam was shocked to discover that she was now dealing with not one but two Bruins fans from her Office family.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>While Jim might've gotten the best troll in the series rivalry, it was Pam who ultimately had the last laugh when the Blues managed to secure their first Stanley Cup victory ever and enjoy one of the best Cinderella stories in NHL history.</p><p>The two of them were both classy in victory and defeat, respectively.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Although it's highly unlikely that we'll see a repeat of the Bruins and Blues in the Stanley Cup finals, I'm kind of hoping that it happens again just to see the trolls this TV couple come up with for each other. And this is coming from a Penguins fan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7auec%2BapGasmJp6sLLFopqeZaOprq%2B4xLJknK2gYrOqusClqg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./atiku-vs-wike-pdp-bot-has-not-addressed-any-of-our-concerns-bode-george.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Atiku vs Wike: PDP BoT Has Not Addressed Any Of Our Concerns">&larr;
