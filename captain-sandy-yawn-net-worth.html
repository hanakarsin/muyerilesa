The crew is getting used to working together and also getting to know each other. <a href=#>Captain Sandy Yawn</a> is back as the captain of the Mustique as they go on charters in the Grecian seas. From missing rosé to attempted hookups away from the cameras, viewers have been given an excellent new season in the midst of a time in which Bravo's biggest hits have been feeling like misses.</p><p>One fact that many might forget is that even though the series is shot by Bravo, the cast is truly working as yachties. Captain Sandy, for example, has had over 30 years of <a href=#>maritime experience</a>, according to her website. She's had an illustrious career as a superyacht captain, and even won an award for her hard work. Her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website bio</a> says, "Distinguished Crew Award for her bravery in the midst of a catastrophic fire and pirate threat that occurred in 2006 off the coast of Yemen."</p><p>She's had an incredible career, but does her net worth match it?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Captain Sandy Yawn's net worth?</h2><p>According to several resources, Captain Sandy's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> is a respectable $400,000. She married her longtime girlfriend, Leah Shafer, in May of 2024. The couple had decided to build their dream home while they were still engaged, and spent $1.6 million dollars towards its construction. However, in an awful turn of events, Sandy and Leah discovered that the developers they'd already paid ran off with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their money</a> without completing the job. The money they took was from Sandy and Leah's life savings.</p><p class="sc-ktvXtq dPyThM"><span>Captain Sandy Yawn</span></p><p class="sc-fxFQrc gpgOkp">Yacht Captain and TV Personality</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $400,000</p><p>Captain Sandy Yawn is a <a href=#>superyacht captain</a> and TV Personality.

A hospitality company they used neglected to deliver much needed items on time. Because of this, crew members had to run over to another superyacht nearby and ask them for some rosé to get them through the charter. Thankfully, the other boat had enough to spare, and the charter was saved. Captain Sandy, however, was <a href=#>rightfully angry</a> enough to end the contract with them.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Captain Sandy Yawn proposed to her now wife, Leah Shafer, during 'Below Deck Med' Season 9 filming.</h2><p>Despite all the difficulties they've faced with their home construction debacle, Captain Sandy <a href=#>and Leah</a> were able to get married and start the next chapter in their lives.
