O grave where is thy power? For even in the grave, Jesus is Lord!</p><p>I close with David’s famous words when he learnt apart the passing of King Saul and his friend Jonathan.</p><p>He said, “Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph…How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places. I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
