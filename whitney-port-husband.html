She was always a supportive and amazing friend to Lauren throughout the entire time they knew each other.</p><p>We won’t soon forget how well they vibed together on the show while working in the offices of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a>.</p><p>These days, fashion designer Whitney — who returned for the reboot series The Hills: New Beginnings in 2019 — has ventured into living a full-on family-centered lifestyle with her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">husband</a> and son. Here’s what you should know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram @whitneyeveport</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Whitney Port's husband?</h2><p>The man who ended up stealing Whitney's heart is a producer named Tim Rosenman, and he served as a field producer on Whitney’s spinoff reality TV show <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The City</a>, which ran from 2008 to 2010. Per his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, he has also worked as a producer on The X Factor.</p><p>Whitney and Tim grew very close while filming The City, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn’t actually date</a> until after filming totally wrapped. They started seeing each other in 2012, and by 2013 they were engaged to get married!</p><p>The pair officially tied the knot on Nov. 7, 2015, in a beautiful ceremony that incorporated a lot of lovely outdoor backdrops.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Wedding Shoes</a>, Whitney wore a high-low lace appliqué dress with Paul Andrew brand floral shoes on her big day. Since Whitney works in the world of fashion, she certainly didn’t miss when it came to looking absolutely flawless on her wedding day.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Whitney Port-Rosenman (@whitneyeveport)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What about Whitney Port's son?</h2><p>Whitney suffered from two miscarriages before giving birth to her son Sonny Sanford Rosenman. Sonny was born in July 2017, and the path to parenthood has been an interesting challenge for Whitney and Tim ever since. On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram, she wrote</a>, “Sonny literally says, ‘I’m in charge,’ and we have to deal with it ASAP. It’s so hard to take emotion out of parenting because we know what’s best for all of us is tough love at this point.”</p><p>She’s absolutely right! Disciplining little ones is never fun, but it’s usually pretty necessary so that they grow up to be well-rounded, respectful, and pleasant to interact with.</p><p>One thing Whitney posts about often on Instagram is adorable pictures of Sonny. Whether he’s all dressed up in a Halloween costume or simply just chilling with both his parents, the content she posts depicting her family life is typically very sweet.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Whitney shared that she was pregnant again in November of 2021, then announced later that month that she had had a miscarriage.</h2><p>In November of 2021, Whitney shared a video on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a> announcing that she was pregnant, but had been dealing with some complications. She revealed in the first seven minutes of the footage that her new pregnancy had been an emotional ride since she was told things weren’t looking good at first by a doctor, but later received good news.</p><p>A few weeks later, Whitney shared in an Instagram Story that she and Tim had suffered another miscarriage.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"I'm so sad to say this, and some of you may have watched on our latest YouTube episode, but we lost the baby," Port wrote on Instagram. "We found out yesterday, I don't even really know what to say here. I recorded a full verbal diary of all my thoughts and emotions last night that I'll put out on my podcast next week."</p><p>"Sending all my love to those of you dealing with this right now. And I don't want to be insensitive by making light of it, but glass half full — I don't physically feel like complete s--t anymore," she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWqwM2esGaon6fBbrTUrJmappQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cody-detwiler-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cody Detwiler - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;
