On July 13, 2021, the supermodel took to Instagram to announce the happy news with a beautiful photo taken by her husband.&nbsp;</p><p>“The past year has been full of tiny surprises, big griefs, familiar beginnings and new stories. I’m just beginning to process and celebrate what this next chapter means for us,” she wrote.</p><p>Ashley revealed in her book A New Model: What Confidence, Beauty, and Power Really Look Like that the couple met while volunteering at church in NYC when the model was 22.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, when is Ashley's due date? The model's second pregnancy appears pretty far along.</h2><p>While Ashley recently announced her second pregnancy, it's evident by her photo alone that she's been keeping the pregnancy a secret for at least a few months. The supermodel had spoken in February 2021 to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WSJ Magazine</a> about wanting to have a second child, and even said, "I would get pregnant yesterday if I could." Perhaps that means she still has a few months to go before her due date.</p><p>Rest assured, fans will find out when Ashley and Justin's second child is born when they see fit to announce it! Their son Isaac Menelik Giovanni was born in January 2020.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Justin has previously gushed about his gorgeous wife on Instagram, captioning a snap of the pair holding a sonogram pic of Isaac, “To my forever love and my daily inspiration… These nine years have played out like a lifetime. I guess it’s because my life really started once you came into it. Now that we’ve made a life together, let’s make a life together.” &nbsp;</p><p>Ashley has also showered her husband with praise for his parenting, and posted a sweet Father's Day tribute to her man. "Happy Father’s Day @mrjustinervin," she wrote. "Isaac is so fortunate to have such a supportive, loving, compassionate, and incredible dad like you. Getting to witness you be a father is the greatest gift."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by A S H L E Y G R A H A M (@ashleygraham)</a></p></figure><p>While Ashley is known for speaking out about body positivity in the modeling industry, you may be surprised to learn that Justin also works in entertainment.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Ashley Graham’s husband is a director.</h2><p>While the 33-year-old is used to being in front of the camera, her beau works behind it. Justin is a director, cinematographer, writer, and producer who has created a multitude of documentaries, short films, and ad campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>According to his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>online portfolio</u></a>, he has even worked with his wife, acting as the videographer on her Ashley Graham x Swimsuits for All campaign. Other popular brands he’s worked on include Rag & Bone and the Adobe Creative Cloud app. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Justin's short documentary, Elephant in the Room, won at the Vail Film Festival and was even awarded “Best Documentary Short” at Garden State Film Festival.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Ashley and Justin typically don’t live on the same coast, although they may have quarantined together.</h2><p>While a long-distance relationship is tough, Ashley and Justin make it work: The supermodel is based out of NYC, while her man works in LA. Though that may not suit the lifestyle of many couples, Ashley told Entertainment Tonight that they have one rule. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“We don’t go longer than two weeks without seeing each other,” she said. “It’s absolutely fabulous. I love it. We just meet in LA or New York. We meet in Paris, Miami. It’s pretty sexy.”&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Ashley’s grandma wasn’t accepting of Justin when the two first started dating.&nbsp;</h2><p>When Ashley initially brought Justin to Nebraska to meet her midwestern family, her grandma was not accepting of the interracial couple. “I never told my grandparents that the man I was bringing home was Black,” she confessed in her book.&nbsp;</p><p>“I naively hoped everyone would be color-blind — which is not what happened," she continued. "When my grandparents met Justin, my grandmother was cordial but cold. She greeted him and immediately walked away. When it came time for them to leave, my grandparents didn’t even acknowledge him.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>She added, “I had never seen my loving, hardworking, and wonderful grandma be so hurtful and so racist. I was in shock.”</p><p>Luckily, Justin did not back down from the challenge and won over his then-girlfriend’s grandma by calling her on her 60th wedding anniversary. She noted, “Afterward Grandma called my mom and said, ‘You’ll never guess who called me.’ And from then on out, she loved him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflsCpuMSyZKCqkZ2urr%2BMoaysmpGjsQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1164521-national-open-university-nigeria-courses-fees-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NOUN courses and fees in 2024/2025, duration and requirements">&larr;
