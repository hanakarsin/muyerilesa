People on Reddit are sharing the things you can only possibly understand if you have siblings.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: 20th Century Fox</span></figure><p>What authority do I have to write about siblings? Well, for starters, I have two of them. I am the oldest of three, and my little brother was born when I was two, which means I have 28 years of experience as someone's older sister. And I have to say, I'm pretty good at it. Now. When you have siblings, there are certain things you experience that those without siblings will simply never understand. The good people of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> came together to list those things.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Accomplices and rivals</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: 20th Century Fox</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zombiebane</a> explains that only people with siblings can understand how a person can be an accomplice and a rival at exactly the same time. One second, you'll be plotting and playing and the next, you're trying to one-up each other and getting furiously angry with each other.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Changing alliances</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beerbellybegone</a> recognizes that especially when you have multiple siblings, the alliances are every-changing, and it can be hard to keep up. "Is my brother on my side or my sister's side today?" they write. And the problem is that there is no way to know. Most of the time, you just have to feel it out.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Laughter over tears</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Warner Bros.</span></figure><p>This next skill is key if you have siblings. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">19you1</a> explains that all siblings know how to make your sibling laugh "so their cries are not credible." If they're giggling through their tears they can't get you in trouble! You just made them laugh!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Apologies not required</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kapojinha</a> claims that you don't apologize to your siblings after a fight. You just start talking to them again. And to some extent, that's true. Siblings get into so many little spats every day that if we were to apologize for every disagreement, we'd never get to bed. That being said, for big fights, I still think apologies are worth it.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Bathroom switches</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Warner Bros.</span></figure><p>I don't know why anyone would but a bathroom switch on the outside of the door, but you won't realize how terrible an idea that is unless you have siblings. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kuro-oruk</a> has no doubt also been in the shower when the lights mysteriously go out and has just had to finish rinsing off in the dark.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Older sibling privileges</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deblebsgonnagetyou</a> says that if you have an older sibling, you know the feeling of them just coming into your room without asking and not being able to ask them to leave because they're older and just won't listen. As an older sibling myself, I have no idea what they're talking about.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. An eye for an eye</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HarpyFA</a> illustrates a situation all people with siblings know very well with one simple exclamation: "Please don't tell mum! Look, you can hit me back!" Anything not to get in trouble, am I right?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Invoking mom</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: 20th Century Fox</span></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Imtherealwierdly</a>, "Mom said it's my turn" is the biggest thing that siblings understand. Mom's word is law (Dad's is a close second), and what Mom says goes. We all know that.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. Blackmail</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MrOreoMan101</a> writes, "The amount of blackmail you have on each other that creates a Cold War scenario." It's true. Oh, you want to tell everyone about my mistake? Well, I have approximately 983 true stories that you don't want out there in the world, so good luck.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. Player one</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Columbia Pictures</span></figure><p>For those who play video games, it's so refreshing, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">megaman0781</a> writes, to finally be player one after you were player two for years. I don't play many videos games, but man do I understand the sentiment.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. Shoveling it in</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney</span></figure><p>If you grew up with siblings, especially brothers, you, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">breadhead84</a>, understand that you end up "eating things you don't actually want in that moment because if you don't have them now they'll be gone and you'll never get them." To be fair, this is also true when you are in a relationship with a dude.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. Sports games</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Buena Vista Pictures</span></figure><p>Oh my god I feel this one so hard.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> cDubz4</a> writes that only people with siblings know what it's like to sit through endless sports games. I probably spent years of my life at my brother's baseball games and my sisters dance recitals. The dance recitals were the worst because my sister was in one dance out of approximately a million of them.&nbsp;I guess I got them back with my softball games, though.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13. Playing dress up</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Television</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Notathrowawayoris</a> remembers basically being used as a doll by their sister and her friends, dressing them up in their clothes, putting makeup on, and making them dance around the house. I would be lying if I said I didn't do this to my siblings.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. Lax rules</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Television</span></figure><p>If you're an older sibling, I am positive you know this feeling. With you, your parents had strict rules, but as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crystalide</a> points out, those rules start to deteriorate with your younger siblings and they're allowed to do things you would have never been allowed to do at their age. It sucks!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15. The holy grail</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: 20th Century Fox</span></figure><p>Probably the number one source of fights in my household growing up started over the TV remote and who could control it. That was evidently the same for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beerbellybegone</a>, who writes that it "was a matter of life and death." They're not wrong.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">16. Seat saving</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Warner Bros.</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patheticgurl</a> remembers "literally dehydrating" themselves just so they wouldn't lose their prime spot on the couch that would definitely be stolen if you got up. I remember doing this exact thing.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">17. Only you can rag on your sibling</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beetleeagle667</a> perfectly explains this universal truth. As an older sibling, you are allowed to rag on your younger siblings and give them as much crap as you want. But if anyone else tries that, they're going to get a beating.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">18. Wrestling</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Pictures</span></figure><p>When you have siblings, wrestling solves everything. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Iilyfeon</a> knows that so much wrestling goes on between siblings for literally no reason. And while it often starts off innocent enough, it almost always ends in a real fight.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">19. Stop looking</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fen_Misting</a> provides this simple exclamation that brings up so many latent feelings: "THEY'RE LOOKING AT ME!!!" I mean, how dare your sibling look at you?! Right?! Awful.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">20. Different perspectives</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Buena Vista Pictures</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HowWasItDetroit</a> explains this weird thing that definitely happens when you and your siblings are older. You end up realizing that you all have completely different experiences and perspectives on your childhood. You remember things one way, and you slowly realize that your siblings thought about those same experiences in totally different ways. It makes you wonder if you even grew up in the same house. But you know you did. You know that no matter what, that sibling love is forever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWqusasZKimnK56tLXBpaCnn6Niwq%2BwxKuqrZmemQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./court-sacks-pdp-governorship-candidate-in-zamfara-says-party-cant-take-part-in-2023-election.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Court Sacks PDP Governorship Candidate In Zamfara, Says Party Can't Take Part In 2023 Election">&larr;
