Does a corrupt CBN governor need to forge any signatures to covet millions of dollars over nine years?</p><p>“But no such monies have been found on him or his immediate families and friends. The sum in question ($6.2million) was never traced to his account nor was he in charge of elections monitoring. So who got the money?</p><p>“They sing about N23 trillion ‘ways and means’ funds created by Emefiele and we challenge them to tell Nigerians how much loans and ‘ways and means’ funds they have procured in just nine months.</p><p>“We know that someday, the whole truth about the trial of Emefiele shall be revealed for all to see.</p><p>“Meanwhile, if half of the energy devoted to hounding Emefiele had been channelled to catching crude oil thieves, Nigeria’s economy wouldn’t be in the free fall that it is today.</p><p>“About 80 percent of Nigeria’s crude oil is still being stolen, according to former president, Olusegun Obasanjo. We all know the oil thieves, why is this not being investigated? Why are they not apprehended?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FxZqKeXZq6prLInqOeq12ku63FjJypoqWVYrG2vsinnmagmah6r7XNnmSynZGnwG61zWanqK%2BVp3qqv4yfpqufmaO0bq7UoZiroaNiwKqzzZqrrqqVYsGpsc1mrp5lkaeybrzRqKydZZ%2Bbeqm1zGaeq6elpXw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./393519-mwanasoka-mkongwe-wa-argentina-diego-maradona-azikwa-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mkongwe wa soka nchini Argentina Diego Maradona azikwa">&larr;
