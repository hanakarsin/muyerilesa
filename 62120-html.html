the sensitization of the local communities in border areas on the need to assist military and security agencies with timely information necessary for their operations; and the discouragement of payment of ransom in all its ramifications.</p><p>It noted that due to the sensitive nature of defence matters, and to allow for members with the appropriate competences to participate, a meeting involving competent law enforcement officers to include Heads of the Armed Forces, Police, Immigration, Customs and Gendarmes of the five countries be convened before the end of March, to discuss the conduct of simultaneous security operations along the borders.</p><p>That meeting, where modalities for a joint military offensive is being worked out, is ongoing in Yaounde, the Cameroonian capital.</p><p>The Abuja meeting also decided to recommend to heads of state of member states to consider the formation of a Joint Multinational Task Force and other related operational issues to combat the menace.</p><p>The forum, which broke into thematic groups based on the issues raised in the presentations, also agreed as follows:</p><p>-Acknowledged and appreciated existing cooperation between intelligence and security services of participating countries;</p><p>-Recognized that Boko Haram has metamorphosed into a regional phenomenon with strong continental and global reach;</p><p>-Noted that the activities of the Boko Haram constitute the most potent security threat to Nigeria and her neighbours with the goal of an Islamic State in Nigeria and eventually in neighbouring countries;</p><p>-Noted Boko Haram’s propensity to instigate ethno-religious conflicts, erode the confidence of people in Government and create&nbsp;&nbsp;a condition of chaos with the use of sophisticated weapons, including Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs), Rocket Launchers and Man Portable Air Defence System (MANPADS).</p><p>-Accepted that Boko Haram has established operational relations with international jihadist groups such as Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Al-Shabab, Ansar-e-Dine and the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO);</p><p>-Noted the increasing correlation between terrorism and arms, drugs and human trafficking, smuggling, violent crime and the militarization of the civilian population of member countries;</p><p>-Expressed concern that terrorism has continued to thrive in the sub-region due to the proliferation of arms, the explosion of Information and Communication technology (ICT), expansion of terrorist networks, easy availability of recruits and existence of safe havens.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3N9kWlloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./pdp-crisis-ayu-blamed-for-peter-obi-kwankwasos-exist-from-party.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ayu Blamed For Peter Obi, Kwankwaso's Exist From Party">&larr;
