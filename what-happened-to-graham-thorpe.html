His death was announced on Aug. 5, 2024, by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">England and Wales Cricket Board</a>, as the organization shared their condolences and reflected on Graham's impact on the game: "More than one of England’s finest-ever batters, he was a beloved member of the cricket family and revered by fans all over the world."</p><p>In 2022, the Professional Cricketers' Association released a statement per Graham's family sharing that he had fallen "seriously ill." Now, fans want to know what happened to him and what his cause of death was. Here's everything we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What was Graham Thorpe's cause of death?</h2><p>At this time, no official cause of death has been provided to explain what happened to Graham. However, fans are assuming that his passing may have been connected to the mystery illness referenced in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PCA's statement</a>.</p><p>In it, they said, "Graham Thorpe has recently fallen seriously ill and is currently in hospital receiving treatment. His prognosis is unclear at this stage and we ask for privacy for him and his family at this time. Our thoughts are with Graham and his family." Again, though, no specific details regarding his illness have been made available to the public.</p><p>Following the announcement of his death, tributes have been pouring in from colleagues and fans. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his official obituary</a>, ECB Chair Richard Thompson said, “Having known Graham personally for his whole career it feels impossible to reflect upon everything he did for English cricket. Graham has been a totemic figure in our game — his achievements and his impact mark him out as one of our greatest-ever batters."</p><p>He continued: "We will miss him, I will miss him, and cricket will miss him. He brought much joy to fans of English cricket, and that will live with them forever as they remember a man who gave so much to the game," he continued.</p><p>Pakistani cricket commentator Wasim Akram was another to comment on Graham's untimely death, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writing on X</a>, "Deeply saddened by the shocking news of the passing of dear friend Graham Thorpe...

He played <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">100 Tests and 82 one-day internationals</a> (ODIs) over that time. In 2002, he reportedly struggled with marital issues, which impacted his game. While some suggest this may have led to his retirement, he made a comeback in the fifth Test against South Africa and continued playing until 2005. Graham was well-regarded and was even named Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1998.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSgqpGdrq5506Gmq6iV</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bret-baier-politics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Bret Baier?
