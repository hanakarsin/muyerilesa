The track came out in 1993 and is a single off the eponymous album. Neria was written for grieving widows who needed soothing and comfort after the death of their husbands. The track resonated with many Zimbabwean widows, as some traditions and old cultures contribute to the suffering of widows in Zimbabwe. In 2018, Tuku collaborated with Ladysmith Black Mambazo, a South African male singing group to recreate the song. This is not the first time the South African choral group has worked with Oliver; it has previously collaborated with Oliver Mtukudzi on other musical gems like “Hello My Baby”.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>15 best Don Moen songs</p><h2>2. Todii - Oliver Mtukudzi</h2><p class=align-left>The song was recorded in 1999 and comes from his Tuku Music album. In this track, Oliver Mtukudzi spreads HIV/Aids awareness as the disease caused a lot of losses in homes. He sings passionately as he laments on the threat that was AIDS. ‘Todii’ became a massive hit in Zimbabwe and beyond, and led to the musician being named as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador. Many organisations used the song to discourage careless lifestyles in Zimbabwe, as AIDS became a plague.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4ab25bb52f0398b8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How Willie D net worth has been built over the years</span></p></a><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><h2>3. Psss Psss Hallo - Oliver Mtukudzi</h2><p class=align-left>‘Psss Psss Hallo’ received massive airplay in Zimbabwean radio stations when it was released in 1990. In the track, the Afro-Jazz guru sings about the shameless habit men have of catcalling women when they walk on streets. Tuku explains that it is a pity that women have to go through that. The video of the track is attention-grabbing. It shows women walking down the streets and how some men blatantly do the cat-calling. The other interesting aspect of the video is the dance which can be compared to Michael Jackson’s dance in Smooth Criminal.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><h2>4.

In this track, the musician takes a spiritual turn and asks the almighty God to listen to him. Oliver Mtukudzi talks about feeling low and being sinful and wants his creator to forgive him and grant him a sense understanding. “Hear Me Lord” is a good tune for one to reflect on, and think about their relationship with God.

Wasakara - Oliver Mtukudzi</h2><p class=align-left>Released in 2001, “Wasakara” is the fourth track off Oliver’s album ‘Greatest Hits: The Tuku Years'. ‘Wasakara’ translates to ‘You are old’. He sings about ageing and how old age catches up with people. In one verse, he talks about telling a father that his daughter has come of age and that he is growing old. The track was at some point taken as a message for former Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe, as he had ruled for too long. The musician later refuted the claims.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/51d783d619993a4e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>25 latest Bongo songs you should listen to</span></p></a><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><h2>7. Street Kid' (1995) - Oliver Mtukudzi</h2><p class=align-left>Oliver Mtukudzi sang this track as an observation to the many street urchins that ransacked bins in Zimbabwean townships to survive. He sang about homeless kids and hoped to bring into light social issues and the state of his country’s economy. ‘Street Kid' is off his ‘My Child’ album. Tuku was applauded for this track as he helped put into perspective what homeless children go through.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><h2>8. Tozeza Baba - Oliver Mtukudzi</h2><p class=align-left>‘Tozeza baba’ translates to ‘We are afraid of father’. The African music giant talked about gender-based violence and domestic quarrels. The track is significant in more than one ways as the Tuku openly tackled issues some families face. At the start of the video, the father is rebuked for being too violent. The video shows a scared mother and child who feel unsafe and threatened by the father. Another approach of looking at it is that Oliver Mtukudzi touched on the issue of political leaders treating their servants with contempt. The song is from his ‘Wonai’ album.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5a39b5465e4169ff.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Diamond Platnumz latest songs, and new videos in 2021: Top 10 list</span></p></a><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><h2>9. Seiko Mwari - Oliver Mtukudzi</h2><p class=align-left>The 2000 track is from his 'Paivepo' album. Seiko Mwari is another spiritual song where Tuku sought to connect with his creator. Oliver Mtukudzi questions many things and asks God to help him define his stand with Him. The title of the track means ‘Why God?’. Divinely, the Zimbabwean star uses the bible as a reference in his song. He talks about Job and Mary and sings about overcoming defeat.

Dzoka Uyamwe - Oliver Mtukudzi</h2><p class=align-left>The fourth track off his ‘Tuku Music’ album tells the story of a son who left his ancestral land for a faraway land but is being mocked because of his skin colour. The mother to the son calls him back home as he will be shown affection and appreciated in his home. The song can also be interpreted to suggest the gap between urban towns and rural life in Zimbabwe. Dzoka Uyamwe was meant to speak to Zimbabweans who were going through misery in townships and to encourage them to go back to their roots in rural areas. The song was released in 1999.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs7shm9q1r33d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Where you can find Diamond Platnumz</span></p></a><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>Oliver Mtukudzi inspired different generations in Africa.
