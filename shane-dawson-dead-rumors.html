During this span, he's had more than his fair share of controversy follow him from decisions he's made, including videos with blackface on more than one occasion. At the time, he said he didn't understand all the controversy and pushback he got over his choice, and eventually admitted that viewers were justified in being upset.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>I like having his name on my chest so the zero people that hit on me know that I’m taken. 💪🏻🐷👍🏻 New Ryland hoodie and pink pig cup up now on my merch site!

"I'm not making fun of them for being black, I'm just looking like them... which didn't offend my audience." He continued, "But the biggest thing I learned is that just because it doesn't offend my audience, doesn't mean it isn't offending mass amounts of people outside of my audience, and that's what I should be more aware of."&nbsp;</p><p>He added, "I made a mistake. I shouldn't have done that... It was stupid. It wasn't mean-spirited, it was not malicious. It was just stupid and I shouldn't have done it."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>i’m not a pedophile. i can’t believe i even have to say that. it literally feels like i’m in a nightmare. <a href=#>https://t.co/i0mo11xNg3</a></p>— Shane Dawson (@shanedawson) <a href=#>January 10, 2018</a></figure><p>Shane has also had to apologize for videos where he seemed to make light of pedophilia, opening up about his past in a way to try and explain where his humor was coming from. This issue arose again in 2020, when an image made the rounds online of Shane pretending to masturbate to a picture of then-11-year-old Willow Smith.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>To Shane Dawson ...

In a video posted to her YouTube channel, she claimed he and Jeffree Star "gaslit" and manipulated her into recording and sharing a video callout titled "Bye Sister" in May 2019 that nearly canceled James Charles.&nbsp;</p><p>Since that all went down, Shane has received a lot of backlash and it's impacted his work and career. He's lost over 1 million subscribers over the past few weeks and has been dropped from major collaborations, including ones with Target and Morphe.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Canceling Shane Dawson is one thing, but death rumors are going too far.</h2><p>On July 27, 2020, the hashtag #RIPShane claiming Shane Dawson is dead started to pick up some traction. He's not dead, but the hashtag seemed to originate from a "fan account" that is branded to look like TMZ which tweeted an image of Shane Dawson, alongside the message, "American Youtuber Shane Dawson dead at 32 #RipShane."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>American Youtuber Shane Dawson dead at 32 <a href=#>#RipShane</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/io1ILArywR</a></p>— TMZ ➐ (@bocasclouds) <a href=#>July 27, 2020</a></figure><p>It immediately received criticism with some saying that the fake news took things too far, and with the hashtag trending in the United States, people were confused. &nbsp;</p><p>"I'm an outspoken criticiser [sic] of Shane Dawson but this #ripshane tag is honestly horrible," one person tweeted.
