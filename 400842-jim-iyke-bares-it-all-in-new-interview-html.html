However, those speculations were halted as it was gathered that <a href=#>the father of the twins is someone she went to university with</a>.</p><p>This time, he has taken a swipe at Nigerian bloggers, describing Linda Ikeji as the lamest of all.</p><p>Speaking in an interview with Glam magazine he said:<i>“Oh Yes! They are bloggers that cannot feed themselves, and then all of a sudden someone informs them that with a few hits, money would be transferred into your account and it becomes an obsession. Any lives that get wrecked in the wake of that obsession, they do not care about. There are some good blogs out there, do not get me wrong. I am not a great fan of BellaNaija, but she is smart, she is articulate, and she knows what she is doing. Even when she attacks me or writes about me, you will know that there is the chance of a researched truth, though it may not be in its entirety. So, there are one or two good blogs out there that make an effort to research. Linda Ikeji is one of the lamest of them all, and some others that do not make any effort, they just cut and paste. There are people who are really trained for this job, they understand this job, people who are intellectually gifted as writers, yet they are taking food out of their mouths because of the new order of things. There is one they call Ladun, me I call names if I want to, I do not care. This is stuff that fellow so called celebs want to talk about but do not have the balls to. This is part of the gains of already being labelled a black sheep, whatever I say now would not shock anybody. I just keep it real.”</i></p><p>His grouse with Charles Novia & Segun Arinze stems from their reactions to his September 2013 deliverance at TB Joshua’s Synagogue Church of All Nations which aired on the church’s Emmanuel TV and later went viral.</p><p><i>“I will deem it completely reprehensible if I say what happened was orchestrated like people suggested.&nbsp;Segun Arinze&nbsp;and&nbsp;Charles Novia, men that I respected a lot, came out to say something completely derogatory of what happened that day. I am not really cool with&nbsp;Novia, we have always been at odds with each other, and nobody asked his opinion on what happened to another actor. Do not involve yourself in people’s private issues, I don’t talk about your wife, I do not say she is overweight, nor do I talk about the fact that you need therapy. I do not talk about your personal issues though looking at you, I am sure you have enormous personal issues.</i></p><p><i>“I do not talk about&nbsp;Segun, I know one or two things about him like he knows about me. We are not that close so he has no authority to talk about what happened in my life. He used to be like a big brother, one that I respect, but he lost all that because of the way he went about this issue."</i></p><p><strong>Earlier report, March 12, 2015.</strong></p><p>The Glam Africa Magazine's Spring 2015 issue was out last week and Jim graced the cover. In an explosive interview with the magazine, he talks about his relationship with Nadia, his ex, Kenturah and also his relationship with God.</p><p>On his relationship with Nadia, he said: “<i>You don't need a soothsayer to tell you nor do you need a fake prophet to spell it out to you. I am the kind of man that drops hints; I do not have to tell the whole story because it makes you lose your mystic, it makes you lose the strength of your advantage over people. But here I am with my BFF, an incredibly intelligent and beautiful person and I think that is what I need in my life</i>”.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>:&nbsp;<a class=row-title href=#>FINALLY! Nadia Buari Speaks Up About Giving Birth To Twins</a></p><p>Before his relationship with Nadia, Jim dated Kenturah Hamilton for six-years. When they broke up, she had condemned him publicly saying his show was fake, and promised to reveal his secrets but Jim had kept quiet through it all.</p><p>Speaking on Kentura, the Nollywood actor said she is an incredible person and will always be a part of his life.</p><p>“<i>In the heat of the whole drama between Kentura and I, people asked why I did not say a word. She released a story to the press about how I wrecked her life, I believe it was the emotions of the moment because that is not who she is and that would never define her, a lady whom I spent 6 years of my life with.&nbsp;You cannot spend 6 years with a Caribbean girl if she is not incredible. In our moments of grief and disappointments, we say things that we do not mean. Would I hold it against her? Maybe I did, but I moved on 5 minutes after, and I do not hold it against her.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>PHOTOS: Is This The Father Of Nadia Buhari's Twins?</a></p><p><i>“I have often said that I don't owe anybody any apology as to the steps and decisions I take in my life. I owe hardened fans an explanation and not an apology.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>“All I know is that someone spent 6 years with me and come rain come shine, anytime she calls me I will readily rise to the occasion. My life will never be complete without her and she will always have a special place in my heart</i>.”</p><p>On the <a href=#>viral deliverance with Prophet T.B. Joshua</a> which stirred a lot of controversy, Jim said: “<i>There are things that happen in your life that if you don't have the answers to, you go to a higher calling to make sense of it. When I got there, in a space of 5 - 10 minutes, something transpired and till this day I do not know what it is</i>.”</p><p>According to the actor, his new found relationship with God has changed him, and made him a more patient and a kinder person.</p><p>The relationship between Jim and Nadia has been controversial, though they claimed to be 'best friends forever' (BFF).</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXF8l21pZqKZonqqxcqeZJuZoprAbrXTZpilpF2eu266xLBkoqakmr%2B3tcSwZaGsnaE%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./62120-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nigeria signs deal on massive, joint offensive against Boko Haram with France, others">&larr;
