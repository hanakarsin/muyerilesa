He has made this much from his business deals and music career. For instance, he gets $90,000 quarterly royalties based on the home video he had with Kim Kardashian, which is about $360,000 annually.

Then, their son was delivered two months ago.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4a2ee664579ad045.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lil Fizz biography: age, height, sister, girlfriend, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Before his union with Princess, the business mogul was previously in a relationship with Kim Kardashian. In February 2007, there was a Ray J and Kim Kardashian superstar scandal due to the leakage of a pornographic home video. Kim and Ray J made a sex tape while they were still together.</p><p class=align-left>The former Ray J wife Kardashian was furious at the revelation, which led to sueing of Vivid Entertainment for holding the video. However, Kardashian lowered the suit and resolved with the firm paying <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$300,000</a> for each tape as well as a cut from the videos sold or downloaded. Unfortunately, the Ray J Kim love story ended after the scandal. In May 2014, Kardashian got married to Kanye West, and it was documented that Ray sent all the proceeds of the sex tape that year as a wedding present.</p><h2>Raymond Norwood controversies</h2><p class=align-left>Since the business mogul and rapper entered into the spotlight, he has been involved in a few controversies.
